Once there was a kind, pretty girl named Kongji who lived in a village. Her mother died when Kongji was 100 days old. When
she was fourteen, her father married a widow who had a daughter, Patzzi. Her father died soon after. Her stepmother and Patzzi
treated Kongji very unfairly. One day, her stepmother forced her to plow a field with a wooden hoe. The hoe soon broke, leaving
Kongji in tears. A cow appeared and plowed the field in her place. Kongji returned home with a basket of apples, a gift from 
the cow. Her stepmother accused her of stealing the apples and gave the entire basket to Patzzi. One day the new mayor invited 
all the people in the village to a ball. Kongji wanted to go, but her stepmother set her a series of impossible tasks. "You have 
to fill this pot with water, hull this pile of rice and weave hemp cloth. If you finish your work, you may go to the ball. The 
enormous pot had a hole in the bottom. Kongji kept bringing baskets of water but the pot was never filled. A turtle appeared and
blocked the hole for her. With his help, Kongji filled the pot with water. A flock of sparrows appeared and peeled the grains 
of rice with their beaks. A fairy helped Kongji to weave the hemp fibers into cloth, completing Kongji's chores. She then turned 
Kongji's rags into beautiful clothes with a delicate pair of colorful shoes. Kongji hurried towards the ball. As Kongji crossed a
bridge, she was surprised by the mayor's sudden appearance and tripped. One of her shoes fell into the stream. Ashamed, Kongji 
ran away. They mayor was intrigued by the beautiful, shy girl. He had the shoe retrieved and vowed to marry the woman it belonged 
to. Servants tried the shoe on every woman in the village, but it fit only Kongji. The mayor and Kongji were married. One year later,
her stepmother found out and could not figure out how she completed the impossible tasks. She decided to ask the mayor about what 
had happened. When she confronted the mayor, he did not know what to say.

While the stepmother continued to nag the mayor, he was adamant that he loved Kongji and did not care how she completed the tasks.
However, despite making the stepmother leave for having the same doubts, the mayor couldn't help but become curious as to what
really happened that night.  He decided he would ask Kongji himself.

Kongji told the mayor what happened at the day they had met. She told him that her stepmother and sister gave her impossible tasks;
however, a turtle, a flock of sparrows, and a fairy helped her get through those tasks and made it possible for Kongji to join the 
ball. The mayor was surpised by how she managed to complete the impossible tasks that Kongji's stepmother gave to her, but trusted
Kongji for he thought that she never lies. Such story was delivered to Kongji's stepmother somehow, and she and her daugher, Patzzi,
planned to kill Kongji. As they tried to do so, the fairy that helped Kongji last time came to appearance with other animals that
also helped Kongji and attacked them. Kongji's stepmother and Patzzi were too afraid of those that protect Kongji, and ran away from
the town, away from Kongji. After they ran away, Kongji and the mayer spent their life happily with occasional helps from the fairy
and its fellow animals.

As for the wicked stepmother and Patzzi. They live in a hut. In the woods. At
a basic subsitence level. Animals certainly don't help them. And this is what
they deserve.
