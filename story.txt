Once there was a kind, pretty girl named Kongji who lived in a village. Her mother died when Kongji was 100 days old. When
she was fourteen, her father married a widow who had a daughter, Patzzi. Her father died soon after. Her stepmother and Patzzi
treated Kongji very unfairly. One day, her stepmother forced her to plow a field with a wooden hoe. The hoe soon broke, leaving
Kongji in tears. A cow appeared and plowed the field in her place. Kongji returned home with a basket of apples, a gift from 
the cow. Her stepmother accused her of stealing the apples and gave the entire basket to Patzzi. One day the new mayor invited 
all the people in the village to a ball. Kongji wanted to go, but her stepmother set her a series of impossible tasks. "You have 
to fill this pot with water, hull this pile of rice and weave hemp cloth. If you finish your work, you may go to the ball. The 
enormous pot had a hole in the bottom. Kongji kept bringing baskets of water but the pot was never filled. A turtle appeared and
blocked the hole for her. With his help, Kongji filled the pot with water. A flock of sparrows appeared and peeled the grains 
of rice with their beaks. A fairy helped Kongji to weave the hemp fibers into cloth, completing Kongji's chores. She then turned 
Kongji's rags into beautiful clothes with a delicate pair of colorful shoes. Kongji hurried towards the ball. As Kongji crossed a
bridge, she was surprised by the mayor's sudden appearance and tripped. One of her shoes fell into the stream. Ashamed, Kongji 
ran away. They mayor was intrigued by the beautiful, shy girl. He had the shoe retrieved and vowed to marry the woman it belonged 
to. Servants tried the shoe on every woman in the village, but it fit only Kongji. The mayor and Kongji were married. One year later, her stepmother found out and could not figure out how she completed the impossible tasks. She decided to ask the mayor about what had happened. When she confronted the mayor, he did not know what to say.
